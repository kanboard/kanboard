What is Kanban?
===============

Kanban is a methodology originally developed by Toyota to be more efficient.

There is only two constraints imposed by Kanban:

- Visualize your workflow
- Limit your work in progress

Visualize your workflow
-----------------------

- Your work is visualized on a board, you have a clear overview of your project
- Each column represent a step in your workflow

Bring focus and avoid multitasking
----------------------------------

- Each phase can have a work in progress limit
- Limits are great to identify bottlenecks
- Limits avoid working on too many tasks in the same time

Measure performance and improvement
-----------------------------------

Kanban uses lead and cycle times to measure performance:

- **Lead time**: Time between the task is created and completed
- **Cycle time**: Time between the task is started and completed

By example, you may have a lead time of 100 days and only have to work 1 hour to complete the task.
