Swimlanes
=========

Swimlanes are horizontal separations in your board.
By example, it's useful to separate software releases, divide your tasks in different products, teams or what ever you want.

Managing swimlanes
------------------

- All projects have a default swimlane.
- If there is more than one swimlane, the board will show all swimlanes.
- You can drag and drop tasks between swimlanes.

To configure swimlanes go to the **project configuration page** and choose the section **Swimlanes**.

From there, you can add a new swimlane or rename the default one.
You can also disable and change the position of the different swimlanes.

- The default swimlane is always on the top but you can hide it.
- Inactive swimlanes are not shown on the board.
- **Removing a swimlane doesn't remove tasks assigned to it**, those tasks will be moved to the default swimlane.
