Kanban vs Todo lists and Scrum
==============================

Kanban vs Todo lists
--------------------

### Todo lists:

- Single phase (just a list of items)
- Multitasking possible (not efficient)

### Kanban:

- Multiple phases, each column represent a step
- Bring focus and avoid multitasking because you can set a work in progress limit per column

Kanban vs Scrum
---------------

### Scrum:

- Sprints are time-boxed, usually 2 or 4 weeks
- Do not allow changes during the iteration
- Estimation is required
- Uses velocity as default metric
- Scrum board is cleared between each sprint
- Scrum has predefined roles like scrum master, product owner and the team
- A lot of meetings: planning, backlog grooming, daily stand-up, retrospective

### Kanban:

- Continuous flow
- Changes can be made at anytime
- Estimation is optional
- Use lead and cycle time to measure performance
- Kanban board is persistent
- Kanban doesn't impose strict constraints or meetings, process is more flexible
