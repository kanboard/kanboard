Closing tasks
=============

When a task is closed, it is hidden from the board.

However, you can always access to the list of closed tasks by using the
query **status:closed** in any search form or simply choose **Closed
tasks** from the filter drop-down.

There are two different ways to close a task, from the task drop-down
menu on the board:

Or from the task sidebar menu in the task detail view:

Note: When you close a task, all sub-tasks not completed will be changed
to the status "Done".
