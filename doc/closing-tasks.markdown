Closing tasks
=============

When a task is closed, it is hidden from the board.

However, you can always access to the list of closed tasks by using the query **status:closed** in any search form or simply choose **Closed tasks** from the filter drop-down.

There are two different ways to close a task, from the task drop-down menu on the board:

![Close a task from drop-down menu](screenshots/menu-close-task.png)

Or from the task sidebar menu in the task detail view:

![Close task](screenshots/closing-tasks.png)

Note: When you close a task, all sub-tasks not completed will be changed to the status "Done".
