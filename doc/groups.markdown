Groups Management
=================

In Kanboard, each user can be a member of one or many groups.
A group is like a team or an organization.

Only administrators can create new groups and assign users.

Groups can be managed from **User management > View All Groups**.
From there, you can create groups and assign users.

Each project manager can authorize the access to a set of groups from the [project permissions page](project-permissions.markdown).

The external id is mainly used for external group providers.
Kanboard provides a LDAP group provider to [sync automatically groups from LDAP servers](ldap-group-sync.markdown).
