Kanboard offers the possibility to send notifications when someone is mentioned.

If you need to get the attention of someone in a comment or in a task, use the @ symbol followed by their username.
Kanboard will automatically suggest a list of users:

- The user mentions works only during tasks and comments creation.
- To be notified, mentioned users need to be a member of the project.
- When someone is mentioned, this user will receive a notification.
- The @username mention is linked to the public user profile.
