There are two different calendars in Kanboard:

- Project calendar
- User calendar (available from the dashboard)

Project calendar
----------------

This calendar shows tasks with defined due date and tasks based on the creation date or the start date.

### Show tasks based on the creation date

- The start date of the calendar event is the creation date of the task.
- The end date of the event is the date of completion.

### Show tasks based on the start date

- The start date of the calendar event is the start date of the task.
- This date can be defined manually.
- The end date of the event is the date of completion.
- If there is no start date the task will not appear on the calendar.

User calendar
-------------

This calendar shows only tasks assigned to the user and optionally sub-tasks information.

### Show sub-tasks based on the time tracking

- Display sub-tasks in the calendar from the information recorded in the time tracking table.
- The intersection with the user timetable is also calculated.

### Show sub-task estimates (forecast of future work)

- Display the estimate of future work for sub-tasks in status "todo" and with a defined "estimate" value.
