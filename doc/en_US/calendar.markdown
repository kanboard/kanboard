Calendar
========

There are two different views for the calendar:

- The project view with filters (available from the board)
- The user view (available from the dashboard and from the user section)

At this time the calendar is able to display this information:

- Tasks with a due date, displayed at the top. **The due date can be changed by moving the task to another day**.
- Tasks based on the creation date or the start date. **These events cannot be modified with the calendar**.
- Sub-task time tracking, all recorded time slot will be shown in the calendar.
- Sub-task estimates, forecasts of work left

The calendar configuration can be changed in the settings page.

Note: The due date doesn't contain time information.
