Tags
====

With Kanboard, you can associate one or many tags to a task.
You can define tags globally for all projects or only for a specific project.

From the task form, you can enter the desired tags:

![Tags form](screenshots/tags-task.png)

The auto-completion form will show up to suggest available tags.

You can also create tags directly from the task form.
By default, when you create tags from a task form they are associated to the current project:

All tags can be managed in the project settings.

To define tags globally for all projects, go to the application settings:

To search tasks based on tags, just use the attribute "tag":
